                    With the ever-growing digitalization of society, so too, should we ensure that such digitalization occurs in a responsible way. 
					Most essential herein is how we may scale information-exchange as such that the principles that would hold in a personal environment, will also hold over the digital environment. 
					Often, one may exchange information that is supposed to be secret, and should not be accessible to anyone else. In person, this is easy because one may personally verify the individual that the information is shared with. 
					In information security, we denote the concept that information should be kept secret as <i>confidentiality</i>. When confidentiality is ensured, then there is no unauthorized access to information. 
					However, sometimes, confidentiality is not that important. Instead, one may rather concern the <i>integrity</i> of a message, as such that one can be sure that the message was made by the right person, and not made by someone impersonating that person. I.E: you wish to ensure <i>authenticity</i> of a message.
					Within an information security framework, it is important to understand some terminology. 
					When sending a message, it may be <i>encrypted</i>, which is a process that transforms the message in such a way that it cannot be read by individuals who do not possess the right tools or information to <i>decrypt</i> it. Decryption and encryption conventionally involves the use of a "key" (a digital string of characters, or some password). It should be noted that the key used to encrypt a message is not neccesarily also used to decrypt the (encrypted) message, as we will see later. 
					In addition to encryption and decryption, we should also include the process of hashing. Hashing is known as a technique by which one can create a unique <i>hash</i> (which is a finite, compact string of characters) from a message. The idea is that the hash is unique to this message, and that even the slightest change in the message will result in a vastly different hash code. 
					Hashes are conventionally used to verify the authenticity of a message, and play a part in verifying whether the message at hand was truly written by the individual it claims to be.

                <h1>Theory</h1>
                <p> Within information security, the currently adopted algorithms (SSL, HTTPS, and many e-mail services) use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>. PGP is an encryption protocol that operates a principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a> wherein a model of publically available and restricted knowledge can ensure both confidentiality, as well as authenticity within digital interactions.
                </p>
				<p> Public-key cryptography, as opposed to symmetric-key cryptography, uses two keys for encryption and decryption instead of a single one for both. 
				The essential concept of public-key cryptography is best described by an example involving instantiated agents. Suppose Alice (A) and Bob (B) wish to communicate. Here, both agents have a key-pair, consisting of a <i>public key </i> and a <i>private key</i>. The public key (often denoted as P) is widely available for anyone, and can be considered common knowledge, whereas the private key (often denoted as S) is known only to the owner. 
				If Alice wishes to send a secret message to Bob, she may encrypt the message using Bob's public key. Using the appropriate encryption algorithms (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>), this encrypted message can only be decrypted using the appropriate private key, which only Bob possesses. 
				
				Alternatively, it may also be used to apply a signature to a message. Suppose Bob wishes to be sure that the message he sends cannot be falsified, and can be verified that he is the one who wrote it. He can then "sign" the message by encrypting it with his private key. The only way to read the message is by decrypting it using his public key, and since everyone knows that only Bob possesses the private key required to encrypt it this way, they'll know that only Bob could have written the message that he signed. 
				

				<p>	
				Encryption of message M using Alice's public key results in ciphertext C as: C = {M}<sub><small>A</small></sub>
				<br>Decryption of ciphertext C using Alice's private key: M=[C]<sub><small>A</small></sub>
				<br>Alice signs a message M as S = [M]<sub><small>A</small></sub>
				</p>
				
				<!-- It should be noted that anyone can compute {C}<sub><small>A</small></sub> -->
				</p>
            
                <p>
				As part of our project, we attempt to visualise the mechanics of public-key cryptography using the epistemic-logic-based framework of the previously handled Protocol A. 
				However, we consider security-related situations: one in which Eve, the eavesdropper, attempts to listen in on the communication between Alice and Bob. In the other, we consider Mike, who is a Man-in-the-Middle, and attempts to not only intercept communication, but also modify messages, and impersonate the other agents in an attempt to distort communication. 
				Within this framework, we can regard how knowledge transition operates by an adaptation of protocol A. Except we now have a third agent (either Eve or Mitch), who stands in the middle of the channels.
				Naturally, the goal here is now not only to ensure <i>safety</i> and <i>liveness</i>, but also to ensure <i>confidentiality</i> and <i>integrity</i>. THis mean that we must not only ensure that all messages sent are also received correctly, and in the correct order, but also that there is no way that any information is read by a malicious agent, nor any malicious, false messages are added by this malicious agent. In terms of logic, we may consider agent A (Alice) and B (Bob), as well as agent EVE and MIM. The private keys of A and B are denoted as SKey<sub><small>A</small></sub> and SKey<sub><small>B</small></sub> respectively, and public keys as PKey<sub><small>A</small></sub> and PKey<sub><small>B</small></sub>. A message encrypted by an agent i is denoted as {M}<sub><small>i</small></sub>. Decryption of an encrypted message can be represented by [ {M}<sub><small>A</small></sub> ]<sub><small>A</small></sub>.
				
				It is important to note that encryption and decryption are inverse operations, as such that: M = {[M]<sub><small>A</small></sub>}<sub><small>A</small></sub> = [{M}<sub><small>A</small></sub>]<sub><small>A</small></sub>. We can represent knowledge using the epistemic operator K, where K<sub><small>i</small></sub>φ means that agent i knows φ. For instance, K<sub><small>A</small></sub> {φ}<sub><small>B</small></sub> represents a situation in which Alice knows (or has access to) message φ after it is encrypted using Bob's public key.

                <h1>Project</h1>
                <p>
					For our project, we wish to visualize a public-key cryptography schema using Protocol A, which is described by Halpern and Zuck in  <a href="#footnoteHZ92">[1]</a>. Protocol A is used to ensure that a sender can send messages to a receiver while preventing deletion errors when messages get lost during transmission. This is achieved by sending acknowledgements that messages have been received. Alice be the sender and Bob the receiver. If Alice wishes to send a mesage φ to Bob, then she repeatedly sends this message unitl Bob sends an acknowledgement K<sub><small>B</small></sub>φ. Alice then sends an acknowledgement on her own to Bob, namely K<sub><small>A</small></sub>K<sub><small>B</small></sub>φ until she receives the acknowledgement K<sub><small>B</small></sub>K<sub><small>A</small></sub>K<sub><small>B</small></sub>φ. At this point we have K<sub><small>A</small></sub>K<sub><small>B</small></sub>K<sub><small>A</small></sub>K<sub><small>B</small></sub>φ. The seemingly reduntant acknowledgements are needed in order to ensure that Bob knows that the next message he receives is a new message and that Alice is aware that Bob has this knowledge because if this is the case Alice can proceed by sending the next message she wishes to convey. This protocol is safe from deletion errors because messages are sent repeatedly until an acknowledgement is received. However, in its basic form, there is no protection against eavesdropping or a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Therefore, in our project we show how knowledge information is transmitted using both the basic protocol A and an adapted version using PGP in order to encrypt and decrypt messages. 
                </p>

				<p>
				For the PGP case, we assume that public keys are common knowledge. This means that everybody has access to (or knows)  P<sub><small>i</small></sub> for all agents i and that everybody knows this is the case (and that everybody knows this etc., ad infinitum). We use the epistemic operator C to express this fact: C P<sub><small>i</small></sub>.

				<h3> PGP as a communication protocol </h3>
				<br>
                <p>
				<!--	The obvious advantage of public key cryptography is that it can ensure authenticity or confidentially of a message without requiring the correspondents to possess a shared secret key beforehand. However, there are limitations when this is used as a communication protocol for two agents A and B.
				-->
					We have here shown the basic elements of how public-key exchange operates. However, there still remains several pittfalls to consider that are beyond the scope of our project. 
					
					Firstly, because the operations involved with a symmetric encryption-decryption algorithm are quite complex, it is conventionally only used to establish a temporary shared mutual <i>session key</i>, and this mutually established key is then used to encrypt the actual content, using a simpler encryption/decryption scheme. 
					
					Aditionally, we implemented our design as such that messages are first signed, and then encrypted, and assumed that neither Bob nor Alice could develop any ill intentions towards one another. However, we can look at two situations wherein the information security principles are violated, regardless of the order of signing and encryption.
					<!--
					<br>
					TODO: MAYBE REFER TO WHAT OUR IMPLEMENTATION SHOWS, E.G. POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON PGP BY MIKE
					<br>
		-->		
					Suppose that Alice desires to convey message M to Bob while guaranteeing both confidentiality and authenticity of the message. She can sign the message using her private key and then encrypt it using Bob's public key and send the encrypted message {[M]<sub><small>A</small></sub>}<sub><small>B</small></sub> to Bob, who can then decrypt it using his private key and Alice's public key. While such an encryption meets the requirements that Alice had when sending the message, it does not rule out all ill-intentioned actions. For example, Bob could decrypt the message to obtain [M]<sub><small>A</small></sub>, encrypt it with it with the public key of a third-party (say Thomas) and send the message {[M]<sub><small>A</small></sub>}<sub><small>T</small></sub> to Thomas in order to let him belief that Alice sent the message directly to him. Since Thomas has no way to know, nor indication, that Alice was not the sender of the message, he remains oblivious to the malicious practices at play here, as does Alice. Therefore, though first signing and then encrypting works formidably in simple settings, it is still susceptible to violations when we operate under a design wherein agents may change alliances over time. 
<!--					to  Ideally, Thomas would know that the message could have been sent by any agent i for which K<sub><small>i</small></sub>[M]<sub><small>A</small></sub> holds, but taking {[M]<sub><small>A</small></sub>}<sub><small>T</small></sub> to mean that M was sent directly from Alice to Thomas is an easy mistake to make. This highlights that such a protocol is more susceptible to human error than to to technical attacks.               -->
				</p>

				<p>
					Alternatively, we can consider an approach wherein Alice would instead first encrypt the message using Bob's public key and then sign it, after which she sends [{M}<sub><small>B</small></sub>]<sub><small>A</small></sub> to Bob, again guaranteeing authenticity and confidentiality of the message. However, if the message is intercepted by a man-in-the-middle (say Mike), he may remove Alice's signiture using her public key and sign it with his own private key, thereby deceiving Bob that the message {M}<sub><small>B</small></sub> was originally sent by Mitchell instead of Alice. Note that Mitchell does not have access to M itself as M was encrypted using Bob's public key, but he can pretend that he is the origin of M. It is clear how this could be an issue for messages related to ownership and property rights. As for the previous case with the reverse order of encryption ({[M]<sub><small>A</small></sub>}<sub><small>B</small></sub>), Bob should know that this only proves that K<sub><small>Mitchell</small></sub>{M}<sub><small>B</small></sub>, and that this does not prove that K<sub><small>Mitchell</small></sub>M, but this requires agents which are completely rational, which might hold for machines, but is less likely for human correspondents.
				</p>

				<h3> PGP for establishing a shared symmetric key </h3>
				<br>
				<p>
				It is for this reason among others, that PGP is mainly used as a protocol to establish shared symmetric session keys for the correspondence between two agents. After establishing such a key <i>K</i>, the agents can encrypt and decrypt messages using the same key, ensuring both authenticity and confidentiality. In addition, situations such as these described above are no longer an issue as long as the agents to not share the secret key with any other party.			
				</p>

				<!--<img src="files/frameshot.PNG" alt="A screenshot of our application" style="width:720px;height:640px;">-->
				<center> <img src="files/session_key.png" alt="Img illustrating establishment of session key"> </center>

				<p>
				Establishing such a shared session key is illustrated in the image above. First, Alice sends a message to Bob stating that she is Alice. She also uses a nonce (or number used once) in order to prevent replay attacks. Bob repsonds to this by sending back the nonce together with the new key <i>K</i>. He encrypts this and sends {[N,K]<small><sub>B</small></sub>}<small><sub>A</small></sub> back to Alice. Finally, Alice sends {[N+1,K]<small><sub>A</small></sub>}<small><sub>B</small></sub> back to Bob. Now both agents possess K and know that the other agent does so as well since the messages were signed. In addition, because the messages were encrypted using the public keys, they know that they are the only ones who possess the secret key <i>K</i> and can therefore use it to communicate securely during their session.
